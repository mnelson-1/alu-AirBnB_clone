# Airbnb Clone
This is the first step towards building our first full web application: the AirBnB clone. We will implement most of the concepts we have learnt so far, like HTML/CSS, APIs, Database storage, and frontend integration.

## Command Interpreter
This is a specific use-case Shell scripting tool that will enable us to:

*Create a new object (ex, a new User or a New Place)
Retrieve an object from a file, a database, etc…
Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc.…)
Update attributes of an object
Destroy an object*

### Starting a Command Interpreter:
Open Terminal/Command Prompt: Depending on your operating system, you can usually find the command interpreter by searching for "Terminal" (on Unix-like systems such as Linux and macOS) or "Command Prompt" (on Windows).
Launch the Interpreter: Once you've opened the Terminal/Command Prompt, you'll typically see a prompt waiting for your input. This indicates that the command interpreter is ready to receive commands.

#### Using a Command Interpreter:
Enter Commands: Type the desired command and press Enter to execute it. Commands can vary depending on the operating system and the installed software, but they typically follow a verb-noun structure (e.g., ls to list files, mkdir to make a directory).
Arguments and Options: Commands can be accompanied by arguments (additional information required by the command) and options (flags that modify the behaviour of the command). These are usually provided after the command itself, separated by spaces.
Navigating the File System: You can navigate through directories using commands like cd (change directory), list files and directories with ls (list), create directories with mkdir (make directory), and remove files and directories with rm (remove) or rmdir (remove directory).
Executing Programs: You can execute programs and scripts by typing their names, optionally followed by any required arguments.
Examples
To list files in the shell(be it bourne again shell(bash) or any other variant), the command is ls.
To change the directory, the command is cd.

*and so on
for this project, however, we would be creating a shell just like the UNIX shell, particularly for our Airbnb clone: Airhbnb*
Let's get started
